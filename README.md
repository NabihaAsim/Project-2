# Chicago Beach Conditions 

Our team researched Chicago beaches and quality of their water to determine whether they are safe for the public. 

The research questions we aimed to answer is whether or not it is safe to swim at a particular beach location. 

The determination was made based on the acceptable levels of bacteria in each sampled location. The reference benchmark we used was US EPA recommended threshold -  235 CFU (colony forming units).
